# Techniques in Acquisition, Computation, and Display of US Census Bureau Data

## Abstract

This article references the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker. The topics in the first 8 chapters presented in the book are followed here. Alternative R packages are used to duplicate each chapter's acquisition and visualization of data from the Census Bureau's API. It is suggested that acquiring survey/geo-spatial data and using [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) techniques provides more control and speed over the data wrangling.
